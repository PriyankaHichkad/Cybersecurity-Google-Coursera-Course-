My name is **Priyanka Hichkad**. I am a cybersecurity enthusiast with strong analytical skills. With so many scams happening around us, I feel an urge to safeguard information and infrastructure. Attacks always happen in an uncertain way, which is difficult to tackle and thus excites me, as I enjoy problem-solving and staying ahead. I always keep myself updated on current threats and technologies evolving around us.

One of my strengths is my *problem-solving ability*. I enjoy identifying vulnerabilities and developing innovative strategies to mitigate risk. In cybersecurity, staying ahead of threats is essential; thus, one must always be aware and ready.

Communication and collaboration are again among my strengths. This ensures that my team and the stakeholders understand the significance of security and their roles, which help maintain a safe environment.

I believe in the importance of ethical practices, ensuring protection and trust. As it is said, with power comes responsibility, and I absolutely follow all the rules to foster accountability and transparency. I always share my insights with my family and friends to make more people aware of cyber attacks.

As I continue to advance in my professional journey, I am eager to leverage my strengths and values to support the security goals of the organisations I serve. I aim to make a meaningful impact by fostering secure environments and promoting ethical practices in cybersecurity. My ultimate goal is to contribute to a safer digital world for all.

This github repository contains all the information, notes and projects done during the course conducted by Google on Coursera.

### Course-1
**Foundations of Cybersecurity** - In this course, you will be introduced to the world of cybersecurity through an interactive curriculum developed by Google. You will identify significant events that led to the development of the cybersecurity field, explain the importance of cybersecurity in today's business operations, and explore the job responsibilities and skills of an entry-level cybersecurity analyst. 

### Course-2
**Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks** - In this course, you will take a deeper dive into concepts introduced in the first course, with an emphasis on how cybersecurity professionals use frameworks and controls to protect business operations. In particular, you'll identify the steps of risk management and explore common threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. Additionally, you'll explore Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) data and use a playbook to respond to identified threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. Finally, you will take an important step towards becoming a cybersecurity professional and practice performing a security audit.

### Course-3
**Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security** - In this course, you will explore how networks connect multiple devices and allow them to communicate. You'll start with the fundamentals of modern networking operations and protocols. For example, you'll learn about the Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model and how network hardware, like routers and modems, allow your computer to send and receive information on the internet. Then, you'll learn about network security. Organizations often store and send valuable information on their networks, so networks are common targets of cyber attacks. By the end of this course, you'll be able to recognize network-level vulnerabilities, and explain how to secure a network using firewalls, system hardening, and virtual private networks. 

### Course-4
**Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL** - In this course, you will explore computing skills that youâ€™ll use on-the-job as a cybersecurity analyst. First, you'll practice using Linux, an operating system commonly used by cybersecurity professionals. For example, you'll use the Linux command line through the Bash shell to navigate and manage the file system and authenticate users. Then, you'll use SQL to communicate with a database. 

### Course-5
**Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities** - In this course, you will explore the concepts of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities. First, you'll build an understanding of how assets are classified. Next, you will become familiar with common threats and vulnerabilities, and the security controls used by organizations to protect valuable information and mitigate risk. You will develop an attacker mindset by practicing the threat modeling process, and you'll learn tactics for staying ahead of security breaches.

### Course-6
**Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response** - In this course, you will focus on incident detection and response. You'll define a security incident and explain the incident response lifecycle, including the roles and responsibilities of incident response teams. You'll analyze and interpret network communications to detect security incidents using packet sniffing tools to capture network traffic. By assessing and analyzing artifacts, you'll explore the incident investigation and response processes and procedures. Additionally, you'll practice using Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Security Information Event Management (SIEM) tools.

### Course-7
**Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python** - In this course, you will be introduced to the Python programming language and apply it in a cybersecurity setting to automate tasks. You'll start by focusing on foundational Python programming concepts, including data types, variables, conditional statements, and iterative statements. You'll also learn to work with Python effectively by developing functions, using libraries and modules, and making your code readable. In addition, you'll work with string and list data, and learn how to import, parse and debug files.

### Course-8
**Put It to Work: Prepare for Cybersecurity Jobs** - In this course, you will focus on making decisions and escalating incidents to stakeholders. You'll develop the communication and collaboration skills needed to inform and influence stakeholders within an organization. In addition, you'll explore how to ethically operate as a cybersecurity professional. You'll discover how to engage with the cybersecurity community, explore jobs in the cybersecurity field, and complete practice interviews. You'll also write a resume and cover letter to prepare for applying and interviewing for jobs in cybersecurity.

### Certificates
